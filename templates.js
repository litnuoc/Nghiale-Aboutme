        <h3>Course Description</h3>    
            <p>Learn SketchUp by developing good modeling habits and becoming proficient in real-world workflows.</p>
            <p>This course is designed for SketchUp users aiming to work at a professional level. 
            It is suitable for both motivated beginners and experienced users, and covers how to 
            produce well-organized, practical 3D models and refined presentations with SketchUp Pro.</p>

            <p>The course begins with creating a custom template and configuring toolbars for efficiency, 
            followed by a detailed introduction to SketchUp’s primary modeling tools.</p>
            <p>During the course, you will create a simple living room model from the ground up—building walls, adding doors and windows, and organizing the design with groups and components. You will also learn how to position and adjust furniture, apply materials and textures, and add custom artwork to enhance the space.</p>
            <p>As you move forward, you will include architectural elements such as trim and baseboards, use tags to control visibility, and set up scenes to save views for renderings, plans, and elevations.</p>
            <p>In the final stage, you will transfer your model to LayOut, SketchUp’s presentation tool, to produce a complete document with title blocks, dimensions, labels, and design notes.
            </p>
            <p>By the conclusion of the course, you will be able to model interior spaces efficiently, manage projects in an organized way, and prepare documentation suitable for clients, presentations, or project teams.</p>

                <p>My research interests have been shaped by a strong academic background in urban and architectural studies, combined with hands-on experience in both government&#8209;funded projects and professional architectural practice. I have contributed to various national&#8209;level projects that address 
                    <span>Urban Challenges </span> through the lens of <span>Sustainable Development</span>. Drawing on several years of practical experience in architectural firms and 
                    <span>Building Information Modelling (BIM) </span> environments, my current research direction explores the integration of BIM into 
                    <span>Facility Management</span>, particularly during the operational phase of complex buildings. This focus also forms the foundation of my intended PhD work, aiming to enhance long&#8209;term building performance and data&#8209;driven asset management.
                </p>
                <p>In my teaching, I focus on equipping students with both foundational and advanced skills in architectural representation and digital modeling. My courses cover topics such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), 
                    <span>Computer&#8209;Aided Design (CAD)</span>, and the application of <span>Computational Algorithms</span> to manipulate and analyze building properties. This integrated approach enables students to evaluate building performance and <span>Typological Studies</span> in a logical, objective, precise, and efficient manner. I aim to bridge design thinking with data-driven processes, preparing students for contemporary challenges in architecture and the built environment.</p>
                <p> Beyond the classroom, 
                    I supervise student research and encourage experiential learning through initiatives 
                    like the National Architecture Festival, Green Summer Workshop, and the International VGU&#8209;AAU Workshop.

                    Outside of work, I enjoy a range of hobbies that help me recharge and stay creative. 
                    I have a strong interest in <strong>visual design, layout composition, and creative direction</strong>—not just professionally, but also as a way to unwind and explore new ideas. 
                    Whether it’s experimenting with typography, analyzing branding case studies, or casually sketching interface layouts, these activities allow me to expand my design thinking in a relaxed, playful way.

                        With a strong foundation in design thinking and proficiency in digital design software, I have leveraged these strengths to create a variety of design-driven products.

                    <p>
                        During my time managing the fabrication lab, I led and developed several hands-on projects, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Layered Lamp Project</strong> – A creative lighting design that explores layered construction and spatial effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fan and Stamp Project</strong> – Modular prototypes utilizing CNC and 3D printing techniques.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decorative Object Series</strong> – Art-inspired pieces combining recycled materials and digital fabrication.</li>

                        Photography and travel are not only my personal passions but also important sources of creative inspiration. Through the lens, I capture details of daily life, architecture, and human interactions—often reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities I apply in design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My travel experiences across cities and remote landscapes have deepened my understanding of culture, space, and visual storytelling. These journeys continue to shape the way I observe, interpret, and create.
